# Codebase Analysis Reports

This directory contains historical codebase analysis reports generated by the `npm run analyze` command.

## 📊 Report Structure

Each report provides comprehensive statistics about the codebase including:
- Total files, lines, and code density
- Breakdown by file type (.ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx, .css, .scss)
- Breakdown by directory structure
- Summary statistics and averages

## 📁 File Naming Convention

Reports are automatically named with timestamps:
- `codebase-analysis-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.txt` (text format)
- `codebase-analysis-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.json` (JSON format)

## 📈 Usage

### Generate New Reports

```bash
# Display in console only
npm run analyze

# Save to file and display in console
npm run analyze:save

# Save as JSON (quiet mode)
npm run analyze:json

# Save to file only (no console output)
npm run analyze:quiet
```

### Compare Reports

Use the `index.json` file to track all reports chronologically. The reports are sorted by timestamp (newest first) and include key metrics for quick comparison.

### Manual Comparison

You can compare any two reports by:
1. Opening two report files side by side
2. Using `diff` command: `diff report1.txt report2.txt`
3. For JSON reports, use comparison tools or scripts

## 🔧 Available Commands

- `npm run analyze` - Analyze and display in console
- `npm run analyze:save` - Analyze, display, and save to file
- `npm run analyze:json` - Save as JSON format (quiet)
- `npm run analyze:quiet` - Save to file only (no output)

## 📋 Report Contents

### Overview Section
- Total Files: Number of source files analyzed
- Total Lines: Total lines across all files
- Code Lines: Actual code lines (excluding comments and blanks)
- Comment Lines: Lines containing comments
- Blank Lines: Empty or whitespace-only lines

### File Type Breakdown
Statistics grouped by file extension showing:
- Number of files per type
- Total lines per type
- Code lines per type

### Directory Breakdown
Statistics grouped by directory showing:
- Files per directory
- Code lines per directory

### Summary Statistics
- Average lines per file
- Code density percentage
- Total file types and directories analyzed

## 📊 Tracking Codebase Evolution

Regular analysis helps track:
- Code growth over time
- Changes in code density
- Distribution of code across directories
- File type usage patterns
- Development velocity metrics

Keep these reports to understand how your codebase evolves and make informed decisions about refactoring, optimization, and architecture changes.
